Hey there, my name is Harry and I currently reside in the East of England, originally from Manchester, UK!

I'm interested in APIs, connecting things together, and doing _all sorts_ of other things! I'm involved in countless small, private projects and work on the development team over at Vortex Studios Chelmsford.

I'm fluent in C#, and semi-fluent in JavaScript, whilst working on my C++ skills! I'm looking forward to what the future holds! Any collab ideas would be appreciated, let me know!
